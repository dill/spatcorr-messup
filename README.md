Slovenian stomach cancer data
=============================

Re-analysis of the Slovenian stomach cancer data analysed in:

Hodges, JS, and BJ Reich. "Adding Spatially-Correlated Errors Can Mess Up the Fixed Effect You Love." The American Statistician 64, no. 4 (November 2010): 325â€“34. https://doi.org/10.1198/tast.2010.10052.


Data from: http://www.biostat.umn.edu/~hodges/RPLMBook/Datasets/10_Slovenian_stomach_cancer/Ex10.html


Analysis shows how to fit the same model in `mgcv`. `analysis.R` has all of the analysis, the rest is data/data setup.
